## SIMPLIFYING WORDPRESS HOSTING
> "We are focused on driving the effort out of hosting WordPress for solopreneurs and small teams so they can focus on what matters - creating compelling sites," said Maz, principal architect. "By taking care of the WordPress infrastructure, security, and management, our customers can simply create more and develop better."

## ADDRESSING INDUSTRY CHALLENGES
The service was born out of the increasing difficulties freelancers and small business owners faced finding affordable, managed WordPress hosting solutions on the public cloud. Pain points included unpredictable costs, server management complexities, lack of scaling capabilities, and companies selling excessive features at expensive price points. 

## LIBERATING USERS
> "The freedom gained from offloading the hosting responsibilities is invaluable for our target customers," explained Simon. "We handle everything related to the WordPress servers and runtime so all they need to worry about is their content."
