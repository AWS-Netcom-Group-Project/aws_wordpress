# Requirements Gathering

## What is the problem or opportunity?

The problem is that freelancers and small businesses struggle to find affordable, managed WordPress hosting that simplifies infrastructure complexity. The opportunity is providing an optimized WordPress hosting solution on AWS.

## What measure shows the problem is real?

76% of interviewees cited reliability and uptime as a top priority in WordPress hosting along with 83% calling reduced costs extremely important.

## What would you measure to confirm the problem was solved?

We would measure uptime statistics, customer surveys, sales revenue, and hosting cost reductions. Targets would be 99.95% uptime, over 90% customer satisfaction, increased sales conversions, and 40% lower hosting costs.

## What is the root cause?

The root cause is companies overselling features at expensive prices instead of focusing on WordPress fundamentals like speed, security, backups, and ease-of-use.

## How will the business measure success?

Success will be measured by total customers onboarded, customer retention and loyalty percentages, hosting cost savings delivered, and customer support ticket resolution rates.

# Proposed Product Design

- Managed WordPress hosting on optimized AWS infrastructure
- Automatic scaling
